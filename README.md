# Data Structures Projects

Welcome to the "data-structures-projects" repository! This repository contains several projects that demonstrate the implementation of various data structures using C++.

Each project focuses on implementing a specific data structure, providing clear explanations, code examples, and usage instructions. Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about the data structures and how they are implemented.

## Projects

### Custom Dynamic Array Implementation

The "Custom Dynamic Array Implementation" project showcases the implementation of a dynamic array (similar to the `std::vector` in C++ STL) using a custom class. The dynamic array provides features such as resizing, insertion, deletion, and more.

Folder: [CustomDynamicArrayImplementation](./Custom%20Dynamic%20Array%20Implementation) 

### Custom Queue Implementation

The "Custom Queue Implementation" project demonstrates the creation of a queue data structure using a custom class. The implemented queue supports standard queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and size retrieval.

Folder: [Custom Queue Implementation](./Custom%20Queue%20Implementation)

### My Own Doubly Linked List

The "My Own Doubly Linked List" project presents an implementation of a doubly linked list data structure using a custom class. The doubly linked list enables efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements in both directions.

Folder: [My Own Doubly Linked List](./my%20own%20doubly%20LinkedList)

### UndoAbleString

The "UndoAbleString" project introduces the implementation of an "UndoAbleString" class. This class allows you to manipulate a string while maintaining undo and redo functionalities. It uses stacks to store the history of string modifications.

Folder: [UndoAbleString](./UndoAbleString)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired project folder.
2. Inside each project folder, you will find the corresponding implementation files.
3. Explore the source code, comments, and examples provided to understand how the data structure is implemented and used.
4. Follow the usage instructions provided in each project's README or source files to integrate the data structures into your own projects.

Feel free to use these projects as a learning resource, reference, or even as a basis for your own implementations.

Enjoy exploring and learning about data structures through these projects! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
